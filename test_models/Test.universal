// Let's setup our types -
P_ is a type of PROTEIN;
MRNA_ is a type of MESSENGER_RNA;
G_ is a type of DNA;
M_ is a type of METABOLITE;

// Let's setup our SYSTEM transfers -
(P_1 and P_3 and M_1) are transferred from the SYSTEM;
P_1 is transferred to the SYSTEM;

// Gene network -
(P_1 or P_2 or P3) induces the expression of (P_2 and P_4);
P_2 represses the expression of P_3;

// Metabolism -
(M_1 + M_2) -> M_3 is catalyzed by (P_3 or P_4);
// (P_1 or P_2) catalyzes M_3 -> M_4;

// Metabolic control -
// M_3 activates (P_1 and P_2);
(M_1 and M_2) activates (P_1 and P_2);
