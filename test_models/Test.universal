// Let's setup our types -
P_ is a type of PROTEIN;
MRNA_ is a type of MESSENGER_RNA;
G_ is a type of DNA;
M_ is a type of METABOLITE;

// Let's setup our SYSTEM transfers -
M_1 is transferred from the SYSTEM;
(P_1 and P_2 and P_3) are transferred to the SYSTEM;

// Setup our gene expression network -
M_1 induces the expression of P_1;
P_1 induces the expression of P_2;
P_2 represses the expression of P_3;

// Setup the metabolism -
(M_1 + M_2) -> M_3 is catalyzed by (P_1 or P_4);
M_1 -> M_3 is catalyzed by P_4;
// (P_1 or P_2) catalyzes M_3 -> M_4;

// Setup the metabolic control -
// M_3 inhibits (P_1 and P_2);
// (M_1 and M_2) activates (P_1 and P_2);
